WELCOME TO IKASAN STUDIO
========================

This project was created using the Maven archetype for studio with the following configurations:

* artifactId: $rootArtifactId
* groupId: $groupId
* package: $package
* version: $version

'generated' Submodule
=====================

The code in the generated submodule will be automatically updated by the Ikasan Studio Designer, it is unlikely you
will need to edit these files directly.

'user' Submodule
================

The 'user' submodule holds the users's code, and can be edited directly. There wre times when Studio can auto generate
code stubs into the 'user' submodule but it will only do so if permitted by the user.

Getting Started
===============

To get started, select the Ikasan Studio panel on the far right of the IDE. Choose the metapack you wish to base this
module on then click the 'click here' button.

If you can't see the Ikasan Studio designer window, or require further explination, please refer to the online
documentation for Ikasan Studio.
