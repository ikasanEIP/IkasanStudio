/**
* Brokers enrich the contents of the existing message with additional data or structure in a number of different ways.
* Request Response Brokers can make calls to other systems such as a database or HTTP(s) RESTful services.
* Aggregating Brokers consume all incoming messages until a condition is met ie aggregate every 10 messages.
* Re-Sequencing Brokers consume all incoming messages until a condition is met and then release them messages as a
* list of newly ordered events. This can provide a powerful function when combined with a Splitter as the next component.
*
* This is an auto generated stub. The user is expected to fill in the details of the conversion below.
* This stub will not be over-written unless the overwrite checkbox is explicitly selected.
