# Note: 1. First row must be the column  headings so that edit as table works in intellij
#       2. Every component is assumed to have name and description so they do not need to be included here
#
# propertyName - Name of the property, used on input screens and to generate variable names
# paramGroup - Aggregates parameters
# causesUserCodeRegeneration - Causes the user part of the package structure to be regenerated so much be confirmed before being actioned
# isConfigMandatory - Mandatory for the component to be deemed to be complete
# isUserImplementedClass - The user will define a beskpoke class that implements the interface, we will generate the spring property but leave implementation to client code.
